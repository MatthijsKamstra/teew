Okay... this is just another tween library...
I make it so it can support chaining method, and no need to make an instance.

so when you want to ease a sprite from (10, 25) to (40, 100) in 100 tick, you may want to write this

Teew.tween(sprite, 100).fromTo("x", 10, 40).fromTo("y", 25, 100);

and may be you want to move the y property down to 120 in 50 tick when the above action finish, write like this

Teew.tween(sprite, 100).fromTo("x", 10, 40).fromTo("y", 25, 100).next(50).to("y", 120);

you can sequence many tween with next function...

hmmm...

so, just hit the wiki and see the Getting Started
